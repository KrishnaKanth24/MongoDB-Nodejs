MongoDB is the name of a company
MongoDB is the name of the database also 
Mongo stands for huMONGOus 

MongoDB is a NoSQL database
A database contains many collections, inside each collection contains documents 
a collection can be assumed like a basket and documents can be assumed a like fruits in it 
there is no set rule that apple or banana must be present, but rather says that it should contain fruits

A collection named orders and document in it can be name, product_purchased price 
the name can contain few items like name user_id 
but there can be a seperate collection for user in which detailed information about a user can be present 
so to retrieve list of orders entire collection can be sent, instead of querying by writing selected commands and conditions
it makes reading faster

since document inside a collection doesnot have a fixed schema

lesson1:
mongodb stores data in flexible JSON-like documents 

lesson2:
it follows a no schema design
Construction of MongoDB:
website-> nodejs-> mongoose-orm-> shell-> mongoDB server-> WiredTiger Storage Engine-> you file(collection of documents)
Mongoose makes handling api easier   

lesson3 :
Mocha is a testing framework
client to web server connection is established when client requests for a webpage 
but web server to database is always established
read or write ops from database-----> there is a deliberate wait---> reply from database(asynchronous but promises used)

lesson4:
umbrella of mongodb
community edition of mongoDB - free version
enterprise edition of mongoDB - paid version 
atlas - you can create a database in the cloud by paying but there is also a paid version
mobile -you can make your mobile a database
ops manager
Bl connector
mongoDB charts - all three are for data scientists helps to analyse data patterns 
compass-GUI - same like robo3t but this GUI is released by the company itself
robo 3T
there also another one called mongo stitch mongodb.com/cloud/stitch

lesson6:
how to install mongoDB
download mongoDB community edition from their website 
install it 
	dont need to change directory
	click complete installation
	check the box on install mongoD as a service 
	click radio button on run service as network service user 
	dont need to change directory 
Run this command in CMD
C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongo.exe
in windows, previous versions of mongodb require you to create data and db directory manually
in latest versions from 4.0 
go to services.msc under windows,  MongoDB server is always running 
even if u didnt run that command mongo server will be running 
(i tried to set it to manual but it is working if i start the server in cmd prompt)
 
Lesson7:
CRUD operations
run this cmd C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongo.exe
this will make the server running 
and > will be displayed (which is nothing but u can give shell commands)
type "show dbs" it will show list of databases 
type "use students" (students is the name of the database) to go into a database if it is created or create one
MongoDB stores BSON data format
type "db.studentCollection.insertOne({"name": "krishna", "age":"20", "attitude":"does not have a bad attitude"})"
will create a collection named studentCollection and creates one document 
type "db.studentCollection.find()" to list all the documents inside a collection
type "db.studentCollection.finc().pretty()" to list all the documents in a more readable format

Lesson8:
how to configure robo 3T
Click file--> connect--> on top click Create--> a new window will come (let all remain the same but make sure port is 27017) click save
now under mongoDb connections box there will be a new entry click that and click connect 
in mongoDB JSON strings are converted into BSON 
_id is not allowed in Json but allowed in BSON
type "db.studentCollection.insertOne({"name":"wilson","age":"20","_id":"123abc"}) 
you can enter your id instead of mongo automatically generating
it is not recommended to give your id ... now if u create another document with same id it will throw an error

Lesson9:
three A of mongoDB
1.Application
2.Analytics
3.Admin

CREATE 
	insertOne(data,options)
	insertMany(data,options)
READ
	find(filter,options)
	findOne(filter,options) -returns only the first element that matches the criteria 
UPDATE
	updateOne(filter, data, options)
	updateMany(filter, data, options)
	replaceOne(filter, data, options)
DELETE
	deleteOne(filter, options)
	deleteMany(filter, options)
	
Lesson10:
unique thing about a collection in which you want to add something or delete something
type "db.studentCollection.deleteOne({"attitude":"does not have a bad attitude"})" to delete a document that contains this entry
type "db.studentCollection.updateOne({"age":"20"},{"address":"wilson lives in chennai"}) will throw an error
	it will say missing atomic operator
	atomic operator is a keyword that starts with a $
type "db.studentCollection.updateOne({"name":"wilson"},{$set:{"address":"wilson lives in chennai"}}) now the prob is solved
	 name:wilson will uniquely identify that document

Lesson11:
you can use updateMany command only if u have same key value pair in many documents	
to update everything with a new key value pair simply set the  filter as nothing
type "db.studentCollection.updateMany({},{"pressure":"max"})
even if any one document already has this key value pair it wont throw error it simply adds for the rest of documents 
type "db.studentCollection.updateOne({},{"pressure":"max"})
above code updates the first document in a collection
